__name for SailfishOS is an app to give you the data you need at a glance.

Add tiles for your favorite weather forecast, pollen forecast, world clocks,
stock exchange watchers, and system monitors.

### Project status

This is at best beta quality software. It is far from finished, and not even
core features are stable. Still, you can use it to check sun times, and it is
quite convenient as a world clock app.

### Current features

Add and arrange tiles on the main page:

- world clock: add analog clocks for any place in the world
- sun times: show sunrise, sunset, and other metrics with a nice graph

Note: searching for places/coordinates requires an internet connection.

### Planned features

More tiles!

- weather forecasts from different providers (Yr.no, MeteoSwiss, DWD, ...)
- pollen, air quality, and allergen forecasts
- system monitor (CPU, temperature, ...)
- quote of the day

### Data and icons

Weather data and weather icons for an upcoming weather forecast tile:
